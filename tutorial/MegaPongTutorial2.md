# MegaPong 2 - Setting Up the Environment

This tutorial show how to setup SGDK development environment using [vs-code](https://code.visualstudio.com/),
with [C/C++ extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools)
and the [Genesis Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zerasul.genesis-code).

I am setting up my development environment using NeoVim. So for that I am using
the **coc plugin** with **ccls** as LSP. I created some scripts to automate some
repetitive tasks in an usual SGDK project there are stored in the `~/.sgdk` folder.
There are some keybindings for those scripts in the `~/.config/nvim/init.vim` also.
For creating new projects there is a template in `~/Templates/sgdk-template.zip`.

The functionalities are listed below. If any other functionality is added, please
remember to update this file:

- Create new project: `new-sgdk-project`
- Build project using docker: `sgdk`
- Build project using docker and open the rom in BizHawk: `sgdk-bizhawk`
- Build project using docker and open the rom in BasltEm: `sgdk-blastem`
