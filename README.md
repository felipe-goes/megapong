# MEGAPONG with SGDK

This is a repository with the study purporses. This was made following the
[tutorial from OHSAT GAMES.](https://www.ohsat.com/tutorial/megapong/megapong-1/)
There you can have the complete tutorial with everything you need.

The difference here is just that I tried to implement the same code using object
oriented programming even though C does not support it natively. You will also
find here a `CMakeLists.txt`, that was created with the only purpose of making
my *NeoVim* development environment work well, and a `.clang-format` file to
automate code formmatting.
